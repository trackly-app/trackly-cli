# Browser lifecycle and recovery

Keep business identity in Trackly and host-specific browser identity local.
Every live tab belongs to exactly one frozen job and existing application run.
Never infer identity from window position, a transient tab number, or title text
alone.

## Local tab ledger

Maintain a local job ID -> run ID -> tab record containing the raw tab
identifiers, browser surface, normalized requisition URL, binding hash,
ownership state, and inspection epoch. Raw tab identifiers never go to the
Trackly backend. If the host persists the ledger, store it in a private
mode `0600` file and remove it when the batch expires.

Alongside the tab mapping, keep a private field-provenance ledger keyed by
execution, run, inspection epoch, and semantic field fingerprint. Allowed
states are `agent_filled`, `user_edited`, `parser_filled`,
`employer_default`, and `unknown_external_change`. Store only local
fingerprints and provenance; never send form values to Trackly. After context
loss without a trusted ledger, preserve every unknown non-empty value and mark
it `unknown_external_change` rather than refilling it.

## Access probes and cleanup preference

A minimal access probe is eligible for no-draft cleanup only after proving all
pre-close conditions: no private data was entered; no form control was changed;
no employer draft exists; the typed blocker and stored requisition are durable;
and complete current controller/user inventories identify the exact mapped tab.

Auto-close such a probe tab only when the profile's confirmed cleanup
preference is `submitted_and_probe_blockers`. `never` closes nothing;
`submitted_only` permits only the existing post-submission close-proof path.
Ask once when the preference is unknown and never silently default consent.
After the three pre-close no-draft facts are proven, the value-free disposition
may set `probeOnlyNoDraft: true` so the access wall does not reserve a target
slot. That assertion is independent of cleanup consent and never authorizes tab
closure. When the saved preference and the remaining pre-close conditions permit
closure, close the exact mapped probe tab once, capture the close receipt, and
verify post-close absence from both controller and user inventories. If closure
or absence proof is ambiguous, leave the tab mapped; keep only the already-proven
no-draft disposition and never claim closure. Tab closure never becomes submission evidence.

For the optional inbox receipt preflight, also keep value-free state keyed by
the normalized configured backend origin, exact batch ID, and a local hash of
the immutable ordered frozen member IDs: `not_offered`, `declined`, `unavailable`,
`search_failed`, `consented_pending`, or `completed`. This state and its
batch-scoped consent never go to Trackly. On recovery, do not repeat `declined`,
`unavailable`, `search_failed`, or `completed`. When an opted-in user explicitly pauses to connect an inbox, keep
`consented_pending`; use `unavailable` only when the user continues without the
optional check. Resume `consented_pending` only after the current normalized
backend origin, exact batch ID, and immutable membership hash all match the
stored key, then require the user to re-select or confirm the exact inbox
connector and account. A numeric batch ID match alone is never sufficient. Never
substitute the client's current default mailbox. Keep `consented_pending` until
there are no positive matches or every positive match is durably recorded and,
when submission authority exists, reconciled, and every match has an explicit
`reconciled` or local value-free `cleared_by_user` disposition. A matched member
without an explicit disposition remains free of form mutation. If a bounded
connector query fails before any positive match, set terminal `search_failed`
before continuing browser work. If a later query fails after positive matches
already exist, retain value-free local classifications for those members, keep
them mutation-free under `consented_pending` until explicitly dispositioned,
classify the remaining unsearched members locally as query-failed, and never
rerun inbox search after browser mutation. After the retained matches are
resolved, transition the batch to terminal `search_failed`, not `completed`.
If `trackly_start_apply_run` later returns a non-null `executionBlocker` for a
member that had no static exclusion, classify that member locally as
runtime-blocked and remove it from the optional preflight completion gate.
Never create a browser binding or receipt-evidence write forbidden by the
runtime blocker. Preserve the member without mutation, do not mark it Applied
from the receipt, and continue unaffected siblings.
If the ledger state is absent
before any inbox search or form mutation, make a fresh offer and never infer
consent or completion. Remove this state when the batch expires.

Backend observations contain only a value-free binding hash, inspection epoch,
ownership state, lifecycle/action codes, and timestamps. Never send the URL,
tab title, employer, role, page text, credentials, or answer values as browser
metadata.

## Reconciliation

Before resuming, handing off, or closing a tab:

1. Request every complete controller-owned inventory the host can enumerate.
2. Request every complete user-owned inventory the host can enumerate.
3. Normalize and reconcile their union against the local ledger.
4. Treat an inventory as authoritative only when the adapter explicitly says
   it is complete. Omission from an incomplete or single-surface inventory is
   not proof that a tab is gone.
5. Reclaim a matching tab only after employer, role, requisition, HTTPS origin,
   ATS tenant when applicable, run ID, and browser binding all revalidate.

Immediately before a session-finalizer call, pass the complete expected and
keep sets plus complete controller and user inventories through
`trackly_validate_apply_tab_keep_set`. Continue only when it returns
`safeToFinalize: true`. This helper is a local validator, not a browser
controller: it does not discover, focus, close, hand off, or finalize tabs.
Unrelated tabs may remain in the inventories. Raw tab IDs stay local.

For every initial tab and every recovery, call `trackly_bind_apply_surface`
with the existing frozen member and run. Use `initial_binding` for the first
surface and `recovery_binding` after a missing tab or handoff. The returned URL
is the only URL recovery may open. Treat its returned member version and
inspection epoch as authoritative; do not reuse evidence from the prior epoch.

The Sola failure mode is the regression model: a handed-off tab can disappear
from the controller inventory while remaining visible in the user inventory.
Never make a closure claim from one inventory surface.

## Close proof

For a submitted application, do not begin tab closure until Trackly has
durably reconciled both the batch member to `submitted` and the saved job to
`applied_confirmed`. A success page or explicit user confirmation authorizes
the outcome write; it does not prove that the write committed. On a conflict,
keep the tab visible while the agent refreshes and performs the one documented
idempotent replay. If reconciliation still fails, leave the tab open and
report a control-plane defect.

`closed_verified` requires all of the following for the current inspection
epoch:

- the adapter declares both available controller and user inventories complete;
- the exact bound tab receives an explicit close receipt; and
- the tab is absent from the complete post-close union.

Record these facts separately with `trackly_record_apply_surface_evidence`:
`surface_inventory_reconciled`, `surface_close_receipt`, and
`surface_post_close_absent`. A post-close absence event is invalid unless it
explicitly covers the complete controller+user union. The backend, not the
agent's prose, derives `closed_verified` from all three current-epoch facts.

If the close request succeeds but a complete union is unavailable or still
contains the tab, the agent must not claim `closed_verified`; record
`closure_unverified`. If no mapped tab is found before a verified close,
record `missing`. Close evidence from an earlier inspection epoch cannot
satisfy the current closure gate.

Do not close a review-ready tab merely to reduce clutter. Preserve it for the
user's manual Submit unless the user closes it or explicitly asks the agent to
close it.

## User-visible handoff receipt

Opening or restoring a controller tab is not proof that the user can see it.
Before saying that a form is open, visible, ready for review, or preserved:

1. Use the reachability proof supported by the preservation path selected at
   readiness:
   - For the session-finalizer path, reconcile the complete controller and user
     inventories and require the handed-off tab to appear in the complete
     user-owned inventory.
   - For the per-tab durable-handoff path, an exact current tab-bound
     user-visible handoff receipt is alternative reachability proof; do not
     require inventories that this path explicitly permits to be unavailable.
2. Before claiming a tab is visible, focus or reveal that exact review tab
   through the adapter's documented presentation action and verify its
   documented visible state or exact current tab-bound user-visible handoff
   receipt. Inventory membership alone is never visibility proof.
3. Report the actual browser surface and any tab that could not be proven
   visible. Never convert controller ownership into a visibility claim.

Do not call `open_in_codex`, open a new app-shell page, or create a replacement
tab merely to reveal an already-bound application. Such calls can create blank
or duplicate tabs without presenting the real form. Use only the adapter's
exact-tab focus/reveal primitive when it returns a current tab-bound visibility
receipt. If no such primitive exists, preserve the bound tab and report
visibility as unverified.

Controller inventory is not the complete app-shell or user-visible inventory
unless the adapter explicitly declares it complete. Never say “only these tabs
remain,” “the blank tabs are gone,” or equivalent based on controller inventory
alone. When the user reports or shows an extra tab, treat that as positive
evidence, reconcile every available surface, and correct the claim.

If the selected path can provide neither its required reachability proof nor
an exact visibility receipt, preserve the tab but say that visibility is
unverified. Do not tell the user to submit a form that has not been proven
reachable from their surface.

## Browser-session finalization safety

Treat browser-session finalization as destructive cleanup, not as a harmless
handoff marker. Immediately before ending every browser turn:

1. Determine the currently live mapped application tabs from the local ledger,
   including frozen-batch members and legacy single-run tabs. If there are no
   live mapped application tabs, skip both session finalization and per-tab
   handoff; never call a finalizer with an empty keep list.
2. Use only the end-to-end preservation path selected at browser readiness:
   - For the documented session-finalizer path, refresh and reconcile the
     complete current controller-owned and user-owned inventory union
     immediately before building an explicit `{ tab, status: "handoff" }` keep
     entry for every live mapped application tab. A controller-only refresh
     cannot prove that a handed-off user tab still exists. Then call
     `browser.tabs.finalize({ keep })` exactly once as the final browser action.
   - For the documented per-tab durable-handoff path, do not require an
     unavailable complete inventory union. Invoke the primitive for every live
     application tab mapped in the ledger and verify an exact persistence
     receipt for each one.
   The mere presence of a finalizer must never override the verified per-tab
   fallback. Never invoke an implicit close-all cleanup or an undocumented
   substitute.
3. Never finalize with an omitted, empty, partial, guessed, or stale keep list.
4. Do not use undocumented per-tab `finalize`, `markHandoff`, or
   `markDeliverable` calls. Use only the browser's documented session-level
   finalizer or documented per-tab durable-handoff contract.
5. Never finalize while creating or restoring tabs; wait until all form
   mutations and committed-state checks for that turn are complete.

A review-ready, inspecting, needs-input, or submitted-but-unreconciled
application tab always remains `handoff` while it is live. Omit a ledger tab
after the user explicitly requests closure, or the user confirms they closed it
directly, and the selected path provides definitive absence proof: either the
complete inventory union proves the tab absent, or the per-tab adapter returns
an exact current tab-bound user-side closure/absence receipt. Without that
proof, preserve the member and enter missing-tab recovery on the next turn;
never claim the unsaved draft survived. Agent-initiated closure still requires
the submitted/applied close-proof gate.

Determine which durable preservation mechanism the adapter supports during
the browser readiness gate and prove that mechanism is usable end to end. A
session-finalizer path is ready only when the adapter can also enumerate a
complete current controller-owned and user-owned inventory union for its keep
list. If complete inventory access is unavailable, use only a documented
per-tab durable-handoff primitive whose exact persistence receipt can be
verified for every target tab. If neither complete finalizer path nor verified
per-tab path is available, stop before mutating the form or entering private
data. A no-op is not a preservation mechanism because temporary agent-created
tabs may disappear at turn end.

If finalization returns ambiguously or any expected tab disappears, stop all
form mutation. Because the finalizer must remain the turn's last browser
action and must not be rerun, defer inventory recovery to the next turn. On
that next turn, reconcile both controller and user inventories, preserve every
remaining tab, and report any loss immediately. Never claim the tabs are
visible or the drafts are preserved until the complete user-visible inventory
proves it.

## Missing-tab recovery

When an incomplete member's tab is missing:

1. Preserve the frozen member and reuse the existing run. Never create a
   replacement run for browser recovery.
2. Call `trackly_bind_apply_surface` with `recovery_binding`; reopen only its
   exact backend-stored requisition URL. Do not use search,
   company careers navigation, redirects remembered from chat, or an invented
   URL.
3. Revalidate HTTPS origin, ATS tenant policy, employer, role, requisition, and
   job identity before entering private data.
4. Increment the browser inspection epoch and bind the recovered tab. Evidence
   from an earlier inspection epoch cannot satisfy the current review gate.
5. Reinventory the whole form. Do not claim that unsaved ATS draft state
   survived a crash, user close, or handoff.
6. Refill only verified canonical answers and rerun every applicable integrity
   gate. If the page shows a changed success URL or submission state,
   revalidate the exact requisition before recording any outcome and never
   activate Submit again.

When protocol 3.6 exact-member recovery created the current execution, prove
three facts separately in the operator receipt: whether the tab was restored,
whether the employer form state was restored or reconstructed, and whether
current mutation authority was reacquired. A recovered tab alone never grants
write authority. A recovered server member alone never proves the draft or tab
survived.

If the recovered origin or identity differs, semantic controls are
unobservable, or access is blocked by credentials or a pre-form challenge,
stop private-data mutation and create the appropriate human action. Continue
the other frozen batch members.

## Tabs from a cancelled fixed batch

Cancelling a legacy fixed batch retires Trackly's mutation authority; it does
not close browser tabs or prove that an employer draft was saved. Preserve each
mapped tab in the user-visible browser, remove it from any active mutation keep
set, and never continue filling it after cancellation. Close it only when the
user explicitly requests cleanup and the normal controller/user inventory
absence proof succeeds. Cancellation is never submission evidence.
