# trackly

Use trackly as the source of truth for current openings, monitored companies, saved jobs, and discovery preferences.

## Search workflow

1. If the request depends on saved preferences, call `trackly_get_preferences` before searching. Do not invent a preference that is missing.
2. Call `trackly_search_jobs` with the user's explicit constraints. Preserve recency, location, remote, company, and role constraints exactly.
3. Use `trackly_search_companies` only when company discovery or company identity is part of the request.
4. Use `trackly_get_job` for the exact posting record and `trackly_get_job_brief` for a decision-ready summary. Treat `postedLast7d` and `latestPostedAt` as validated posting-date signals only; never substitute first-seen time for a posting date.
5. Present returned facts as returned by trackly. Label any model inference as an inference and never imply a posting is still open when trackly reports otherwise.
6. Call `trackly_update_status` only after the user chooses a job or explicitly asks to update its status. Marking a job `applied` additionally requires Apply write permission because it reconciles the application run; never use it to infer or claim submission.

Do not rescore an approved application inside this discovery skill. When the user asks to finish Apply setup, resolve missing profile or resume requirements, or fill an approved application, use the `trackly-apply` skill.

## Scope boundary

This plugin supports job and company search, job briefs, tracking, and application filling. Employee discovery and referral intelligence are outside its scope.
