# trackly-cli

The only job tracking CLI built for AI agents.

Search 170,000+ jobs across 3,800+ companies and 40+ ATS types. Track applications, get AI-powered recommendations, and manage your job search -- from the terminal or through Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible AI agents.

## Two ways to connect

### 🚀 Option 1: One-click in Claude co-work, Claude Desktop, ChatGPT (no install)

Use Trackly directly inside your AI — zero config:

1. Open Settings → Connectors → **Add custom connector**
2. URL: `https://mcp.usetrackly.app/api/mcp`
3. Click **Add** → sign in with Google → done

**[Full setup guide with screenshots →](https://usetrackly.app/connector)**

Works in: Claude co-work (web), Claude Desktop, ChatGPT Connectors, and any MCP client that supports remote/streamable-http connectors.

### 💻 Option 2: CLI install (for Cursor, Windsurf, or terminal use)

```bash
npm install -g trackly-cli    # may need: sudo npm install -g trackly-cli
trackly login
trackly jobs --function product
```

> **Prerequisites:** [Node.js 20.20+ or 22.22+](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS recommended). On macOS with the official `.pkg` installer, global npm installs may require `sudo`.

## At a Glance

trackly agent doctor                 # Verify setup, profile, resume, and compatibility
trackly agent diagnose-path /path/to/upload.pdf --errno ENOSPC --json  # Diagnose one exact local path
```

Add `--json` to any command for JSON output. Use `--api-key <key>` or `--base-url <url>` as one-off global flags when needed.

`trackly preferences --json` returns only `success`, `experienceFilterV2Available`, and `preferences`. The availability flag controls whether this client may edit role-specific limits; it does not claim that feed or alert enforcement is active. Every update checks that flag and the latest preference revision before writing.

## MCP Server Setup

### Hosted (Claude co-work, Claude Desktop, ChatGPT)

No install. In your AI tool, open **Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector** and enter:

```text
https://mcp.usetrackly.app/api/mcp
```

Sign in with Google when prompted. [Full visual guide →](https://usetrackly.app/connector)

### Local (CLI via stdio, for Cursor / Windsurf / Claude Code)

For agent-assisted form filling on macOS, install the public skill and local MCP together:

```bash
trackly agent setup --client codex    # or claude / both
trackly agent doctor
```

The skill uses the profile and default resume in your Trackly account, asks only missing questions, fills user-approved saved jobs, and always stops before Submit. “Fill the next N” continues through the original recent-first Check Later snapshot until N unauthenticated forms are durably ready for your manual review; authentication walls and exclusions are reported separately and do not consume the target. An explicit “inspect the next N records” request still uses one fixed immutable batch. Support is fetched from Trackly at the start of every run: Greenhouse is full, Ashby and Lever are best effort, and 27 additional named ATS/provider classes use constrained guided mode. Employer-hosted unknown forms run only when Trackly binds them to a verified company domain. LinkedIn-hosted forms and unverified origins remain manual-only; a separately stored external application URL is evaluated under its own ATS and origin policy.

Guided mode is deliberately fail-closed. The agent stops on credential entry, OTP/email verification, CAPTCHA/human verification, an unexpected employer or origin, a submit-only transition, or any field whose committed state cannot be observed. `trackly agent doctor` checks the local skill, MCP registration, protocol compatibility, declared browser/computer-use configuration, profile completeness, and default-resume metadata. Live semantic browser capability and the exact resume bytes are verified at the start of a real run.

#### Claude Code one-liner

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user trackly -- trackly mcp
```

Or equivalently:

```bash
claude mcp add-json --scope user trackly '{"command":"trackly","args":["mcp"]}'
```

#### Claude Code manual config

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "trackly": {
      "command": "trackly",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor / Windsurf

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json` or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (same schema works for Windsurf):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "trackly": {
      "command": "trackly",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then use natural language in any of these clients:

- "Find me PM jobs at fintech companies"
- "What remote engineering roles are available?"
- "Mark job 1234 as applied"

## Authentication

### Option 1: Google OAuth (recommended)

```bash
trackly login
```

Opens your browser for Google sign-in. Tokens are stored locally at `~/.trackly/config.json`.

Trackly is currently opening new memberships through a limited, invite-based
rollout. Existing members can keep using OAuth and API keys normally. If a new
account is not yet eligible, the CLI returns an invitation-specific message
instead of suggesting repeated login attempts; request a future seat at
[usetrackly.app/early-access](https://usetrackly.app/early-access).

### Option 2: API Key

Existing members can use an API key for firewalls, headless servers, or CI:

1. Sign in at [usetrackly.app](https://usetrackly.app)
2. Go to **Settings → API Keys → Create**
3. Save the key:

```bash
trackly config --api-key trk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Or pass it per-command:

```bash
trackly --api-key trk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx jobs --json
```

Or set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export TRACKLY_API_KEY=trk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
trackly jobs
```

### Generate a key from the CLI

If you're already logged in via OAuth, you can create a key without visiting the web app:

```bash
trackly api-key create --name "my-script"
trackly api-key list
```

### Other config

```bash
trackly config --clear-api-key           # Clear stored API key
trackly config --base-url http://127.0.0.1:3000  # Point at a different backend
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How do I track job applications from the terminal?**

Install trackly-cli (`npm install -g trackly-cli`), authenticate with `trackly login` or configure an API key, then use `trackly jobs` to browse openings and `trackly apply <id>` to mark applications. All data syncs with the Trackly web app at usetrackly.app.

**What MCP servers exist for job searching?**

trackly-cli includes a built-in MCP server with 58 tools: the complete Trackly
job-search and application set plus `get_more_tools`, which lets agents report
a missing capability. Run `trackly mcp` or use
`trackly agent setup --client claude`.

MCP usage analytics are on by default and relay through Trackly so the free
service can be debugged and improved. They exclude résumé text, profile answers,
demographic or work-authorization answers, and application notes. Turn off future
collection with **Share usage analytics** in Account Settings. Operators may also
disable local MCP instrumentation with `TRACKLY_MCP_ANALYTICS_DISABLED=1` (or
`TRACKLY_MCP_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=0`); the account setting remains authoritative
for authenticated backend capture.

**How do I use Claude Code for job hunting?**

Add trackly as an MCP server in Claude Code. Then ask questions naturally: "Find PM jobs at fintech companies in SF", "What companies are hiring for engineering?", or "Mark job 1234 as applied." Claude will use trackly's MCP tools to search and manage your applications.

**What are the best CLI tools for job search?**

trackly-cli is the first dedicated job tracking CLI. It provides direct terminal access to 170,000+ job postings across 3,800+ companies, with filters for job function, location, and work modality. It also integrates with AI agents via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Security

- OAuth tokens stored in `~/.trackly/config.json` with 0600 permissions
- API keys can be stored in the same config file or passed per-command
- OAuth callback bound to 127.0.0.1 only
- Authenticated requests require HTTPS unless you are pointing at localhost
- HTTP requests time out instead of hanging indefinitely
- CSRF protection on login flow
- See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting
