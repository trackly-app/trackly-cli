# trackly-cli

The only job tracking CLI built for AI agents.

Search 128,000+ jobs across 1,900+ companies and 40+ ATS types. Track applications, get AI-powered recommendations, and manage your job search -- from the terminal or through Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible AI agents.

## Two ways to connect

### 🚀 Option 1: One-click in Claude co-work, Claude Desktop, ChatGPT (no install)

Use Trackly directly inside your AI — zero config:

1. Open Settings → Connectors → **Add custom connector**
2. URL: `https://mcp.usetrackly.app/api/mcp`
3. Click **Add** → sign in with Google → done

**[Full setup guide with screenshots →](https://usetrackly.app/connect)**

Works in: Claude co-work (web), Claude Desktop, ChatGPT Connectors, and any MCP client that supports remote/streamable-http connectors.

### 💻 Option 2: CLI install (for Cursor, Windsurf, or terminal use)

```bash
npm install -g trackly-cli    # may need: sudo npm install -g trackly-cli
trackly login
trackly jobs --function product
```

> **Prerequisites:** [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS recommended). On macOS with the official `.pkg` installer, global npm installs may require `sudo`.

## MCP Server Setup

### Hosted (Claude co-work, Claude Desktop, ChatGPT)

No install. In your AI tool, open **Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector** and enter:

```text
https://mcp.usetrackly.app/api/mcp
```

Sign in with Google when prompted. [Full visual guide →](https://usetrackly.app/connect)

### Local (CLI via stdio, for Cursor / Windsurf / Claude Code)

#### Claude Code one-liner

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user trackly -- trackly mcp
```

Or equivalently:

```bash
claude mcp add-json --scope user trackly '{"command":"trackly","args":["mcp"]}'
```

#### Claude Code manual config

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "trackly": {
      "command": "trackly",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor / Windsurf

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json` or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (same schema works for Windsurf):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "trackly": {
      "command": "trackly",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then use natural language in any of these clients:

- "Find me PM jobs at fintech companies"
- "What remote engineering roles are available?"
- "Mark job 1234 as applied"

## MCP Tools Reference

## Authentication

### Option 1: Google OAuth (recommended)

```bash
trackly login
```

Opens your browser for Google sign-in. Tokens are stored locally at `~/.trackly/config.json`.

### Option 2: API Key

If OAuth doesn't work (firewalls, headless servers, CI), use an API key instead:

1. Sign in at [usetrackly.app](https://usetrackly.app)
2. Go to **Settings → API Keys → Create**
3. Save the key:

```bash
trackly config --api-key trk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Or pass it per-command:

```bash
trackly --api-key trk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx jobs --json
```

Or set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export TRACKLY_API_KEY=trk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
trackly jobs
```

### Generate a key from the CLI

If you're already logged in via OAuth, you can create a key without visiting the web app:

```bash
trackly api-key create --name "my-script"
trackly api-key list
```

### Other config

```bash
trackly config --clear-api-key           # Clear stored API key
trackly config --base-url http://127.0.0.1:3000  # Point at a different backend
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How do I track job applications from the terminal?**

Install trackly-cli (`npm install -g trackly-cli`), authenticate with `trackly login` or configure an API key, then use `trackly jobs` to browse openings and `trackly apply <id>` to mark applications. All data syncs with the Trackly web app at usetrackly.app.

**What MCP servers exist for job searching?**

trackly-cli includes a built-in MCP server with 10 tools for job search, company lookup, and application tracking. Run `trackly mcp` or add it to Claude Code with `claude mcp add --scope user trackly -- trackly mcp`. It connects to a live database of 128,000+ jobs across 1,900+ companies.

**How do I use Claude Code for job hunting?**

Add trackly as an MCP server in Claude Code. Then ask questions naturally: "Find PM jobs at fintech companies in SF", "What companies are hiring for engineering?", or "Mark job 1234 as applied." Claude will use trackly's MCP tools to search and manage your applications.

**What are the best CLI tools for job search?**

trackly-cli is the first dedicated job tracking CLI. It provides direct terminal access to 128,000+ job postings across 1,900+ companies, with filters for job function, location, and work modality. It also integrates with AI agents via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
