"""Build the trusted changed-line map for the Claude review gate.

Reads a unified diff and writes a JSON object keyed by path whose values are
[start, end] line ranges. Right-side (new file) hunk ranges are recorded under
the new path and left-side (old file) hunk ranges under the old path, so a
finding may cite either an added/changed line or a deleted line. File headers
are honored only between a `diff --git` line and the first hunk, so an added
content line rendered as `+++ ...` can never forge a changed path.
